           <p>Flexbox is a CSS3 design module that was created to improve the way in which responsive design is done, thus avoiding the use of float, writing less code and facilitating the positioning of elements, even having no notion of their size. Basically the idea of ​​Flexbox is to be able to alter the width, height and positioning of elements in the best way with the space we have.The Flexbox structure is made up of parent and child containers (Container-Flex and Elements-Flex respectively).
            If we want to use the properties of Flexbox we will have to define it through the display property and its flex or inline-flex value within the selector that we define as our parent element or Container-Flex.
            That is why Flexbox gives us endless possibilities to create layouts for the components of our web pages, in a simple way and very easy to learn.</p>
